Developed under the aegis of NIC, Govt. of India, "Exim Guide" aims to serve as a single query window for people who are involved in Indian trade. The app provides important details like ITC & IEC codes, Tariff Calculator ,Web Links and address of Trade Associations. The need for such an app stems from the latent demand for availability of credible and up-to-date information for people involved in trade. The mantra followed during development has been that of providing updated and relevant information only, sans the complexities. Various stakeholders like shipping agents, stevedores, freight forwarders and related parties would find this app particularly useful for mining for data like tariffs, codes, links for various ports and exchange tariffs
